This is my second attempt setting up a repo for this project. I'm not sure where I failed last time but with this new login I've studied the git commands and commits and things are starting to make a little more sense. 

Hopefully when I commit this I'll have a fairly respectable looking webpage to display a few of my favorite recipes.
